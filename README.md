# matestack-ui-materialize
styled components and templates for matestack-ui using [MaterializeCSS](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize)

## Intention
We want to make it as easy as possible to create good looking UIs with matestack. Therefore, we're implementing a rich set of material UI components and bundle them in this repo. It will be an optional add-on to matestack-ui-core. Many other design add-ons (e.g. bootstrap) may be created on top of matestack-ui-core. The main goals are:

* Avoid using multiple css classes in order to apply desired styles
* Reduce DOM-complexity a css framework often brings with it
* Create an expressive UI-Definition within your matestack-pages (rather than divs with a bunch of css classes)

## State
This repo has nothing to offer yet. We're working on a first stable and documented release, which is gonna be published here asap.
